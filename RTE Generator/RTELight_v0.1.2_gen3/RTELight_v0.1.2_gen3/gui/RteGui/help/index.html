<h2><a name="Prerequisites_and_first_installation">Prerequisites and first installation</a></h2>
<h3>Python Installation</h3>
<p>RTEGen is a Python application, which means you must install Python v3.7 or 
higher on your computer and add the installation location to your path variable.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Download Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/">
	https://www.python.org/</a> </li>
	<li>Add &lt;Your Installation Directory&gt;\bin to your environment variable. 
	Note: As you might have other Python installations on your computer, we 
	recommend to place Python on one of the first positions.Alternatively you 
	can of course also call the Python binary using an explicite path.</li>
</ol>
<p>Open a CMD or Powershell window and start python (simply type python and hit 
enter). Check theat the correct version is opened. Leave the Python console by 
hitting CTRL-Z.</p>
<h3>Additional Python Packages</h3>
<p>In the next step, the additional packages for the GUI and the generator need 
to be installed.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open a powershell box in the gui folder (containing the file 
	requirements.txt)</li>
	<li>Run &quot;python -m pip install -r requirements.txt&quot;</li>
	<li>Repeat the same in the folder gen_jinja2</li>
</ol>
<h3>Starting the Application</h3>
<p>Now it's time for a first test run. Execute the file run.bat in the folder 
gui and the GUI program should open.</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><img alt="GUI opening Screen" src="gui_01.PNG"></p>
<h2><a name="Example_Use_Case_RemoteControl">Example Use Case RemoteControl</a></h2>
<p>In order to understand the program, we will create a simple application in 
this tutorial, which will guide you step by step through the process. The sample
<a href="remote/remote.xml" target="_blank">project file</a> used for this 
tutorial as well as the<a href="remote/out" target="_blank"> generated sources</a> 
are stored in the help folder under <a href="remote" target="_blank">remote</a>. The complete project code can 
be found as PSOC project in the folder <a href="remote/project" target="_blank">
project</a>.</p>
<p>In our sample application, we are creating an embedded remote control. The 
remote control will read data from different ports and translate this data into 
a UART protocol, which is send out via a Zigbee module. In addition, incoming 
protocols are being parsed and the payload is translated into events for a state 
machine implementation. And last but not least certain data is shown on a small 
TFT display.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Remote Control" height="470" src="remote.png" width="275"></p>
<h3>Understanding the intended system behaviour</h3>
<p>The high level design of the system is shown in the diagram below. We have 3 
software components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>SWC_remote will contain the code for the communication over Zigbee</li>
	<li>SWC_control will be the main component, providing the code for reading 
	in data from the joysticks and buttons as well as from the Zigbee. In 
	addition, the outgoing protocols are assembled here</li>
	<li>SWC_tft will contain the code to display certain data on the TFT</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note the signals between the components.</p>
<ul>
	<li>so_event_rx contains the payload of the received Zigbee protocol in a 
	abstracted way. This allows us to limit protocol changes to the component 
	SWC_remote</li>
	<li>so_event_tx contains data to be sent out from the remote control. Again, 
	this signal is a rather abstract representation, the translation into a 
	transmission protocol is handdled by SWC_remote</li>
	<li>so_display finally is a collection of data which shall be shown on the 
	display</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="High Level Model" height="275" src="model_1.PNG" width="1060"></p>
<p>Zooming into the component SWC_remote, we wamt to implement the following 
signal flow:</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="SWC_remote detailled view" height="573" src="model_2.PNG" width="1183"></p>
<ul>
	<li>the signal so_protocol_rx, containing the protocol data coming from the 
	Zigbee, will be read by the runnable REMOTE_readPrrotocol_run (correct 
	protocol data) or REMOTE_readProtocolError_run (incorrect protocol data, 
	e.g. wrong CRC, miising byte,...).</li>
	<li>The runnable readProtocol_run will be triggered by a user event which 
	will be fired from the receiving interrupt service rooutine isr_rx once an 
	end-of-protocol character is received</li>
	<li>In case of a correct protocol, the protocol payload will be translated 
	into a more abstract signal so_event_rx</li>
	<li>For the transmission side, reverse signals are being defined</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the more complex SWC_control structure, we find 2 runnables</p>
<ul>
	<li>CONTROL_readButtonJoystick_run will be triggered every 10ms and will 
	read and provide joystick values and button states.</li>
	<li>The joystick signal is translated as so_joystick, whereas the buttons 
	are translated into an event signal so_event_rx.</li>
	<li>The rationale behind the abstraction of the button signal: Both the 
	protocols being received from the Zigbee as well as the button press 
	operations act as input signals for the state machine implementation in 
	CONTROL_processState_run.</li>
	<li>I.e. this runnable will be activated if either a received protocol 
	requires an action, or a button press.</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="SWC_control detailled view" height="555" src="model_3.PNG" width="1229"></p>
<p>The final runnable SWC_tft again is pretty simple - the signal received from 
the central state machine will be shown on the display, whenever this signal is 
being updated.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="SWC_tft detailled view" height="405" src="model_4.PNG" width="890"></p>
<h2><a name="RTE_GUI">RTE GUI</a></h2>
<h3>Menu</h3>
<p>The file menu allows you to load and save your project file. Furthermore the 
generator is started from this menu. The Help menu opens this help document.</p>
<h3>Creating a model in the RTEgen light tool</h3>
<p>For entering the data into the tool, you more or less fowllow the tabs from 
left to right. On the configuration tab, you typically will only modify the 
output path, if required.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Configuration Tab" height="443" src="gui_02.PNG" width="897"></p>
<p>The same is true for the naming convention tab. The following naming 
conventions have proven to be a good choice when it comes to code readability.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Naming Convention Tab" height="1071" src="gui_03.PNG" width="897"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first project related and more interesting tab is the signal pool. 
Signals pools can be used to map signals into specific regions, which are 
protected by the MPU. A typical use case would be the implementation of 2 or 
more safety functions, using different signals. To ensure freedom from 
interferance, these signals can be placed into separate pools, which are 
protected by the MPU. Depending on the OS capabilities, the runnables using the 
signals also must be placed in different tasks.</p>
<p>As the PSOC does not have a MPU, we only have one signal pool sp_common, 
containing all signals.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="SignalPool Tab" height="1071" src="gui_04.PNG" width="897"></p>
<p>In the tab tasks, the tasks which will be used to execute the runnables will 
be defined.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Task Tab" height="1071" src="gui_05.PNG" width="897"></p>
<ul>
	<li>The shortname should be a descriptive name. In our exable, com 
	reporesents a communication task</li>
	<li>The name is autimatically generated by adding the prefix and postfix 
	entry from the naming convention tab to the shortname. This will be the name 
	used in the code.</li>
	<li>The description should explain the job of the task. This text will be 
	exported as comment.</li>
	<li>The timertick period defines the ticktime of the task, in case cyclic 
	runnables are being called. The value is application specific and must be a 
	common divider of all runnable times. If e.g. run_1 is executed every 10ms 
	and run_2 is executed every 25ms, a good value would be 5ms.Depending in the 
	RTOS, the ticktime and corresponding event must be configured manually in 
	the RTOS and kept in sync.</li>
	<li>The tickevent represent the event used for the task tick.</li>
	<li>The mode describes, how the runnables are triggered. Only cyclically, 
	only by event or both. Depending on this setting, different templates for 
	the task creation will be used. </li>
	<li>SignalpoolRO: Will contain all signal pools, to which the task will get 
	readonly access</li>
	<li>SignalpoolRW: Will contain all signal pools, to which the task will get 
	readwrite access</li>
	<li>Events: Here all events must be ticked, which are required IN ADDITION 
	to the onData and tick events. In this case, only the user event being fired 
	from the ISR after receiving a full protocol must be added. All other 
	events, which are linked to signals, are automatically considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Erika tasks, please consider the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Event based tasks are Extended Tasks and typically only called by onData 
	and onError events from the signals</li>
	<li>Cyclic tasks are Basic Tasks activated by an alarm</li>
	<li>Cyclic and Event based tasks are implemented as Extended Task. For the 
	Cyclic Event, you must define an additional event in the RTELight (Section 
	events) and activate this by an Alarm in Erika. Of course the time bases 
	must be kept in sync.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the tab signal classes, the interfaces of the ports / data types required 
for signal objects are being defined. Please note, that the generator will 
create an empty structure / enum / typedef for every class. The content is added 
and maintained in the generated file directly.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Signal Class Tab" height="1071" src="gui_06.PNG" width="897"></p>
<p>In the tab signal objects, we create the individual data objects and 
configure the system behaviour in case of data changes.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The shortname should be a descriptive name of the signal content. Please 
	note, that the type and object should have different names, typically the 
	object is a bit more specific. E.g. so_protocolRx and so_protocolTx are both 
	signal object of the class sc_Protocol.</li>
	<li>The name is created by adding the pre- and postfixes defined in the tab 
	Naming conventions</li>
	<li>The description should be a good description of the signal task. The 
	description will be created as comment in the code.</li>
	<li>The signal class defines the type of the signal</li>
	<li>The indriver and outdriver define driver functions, which may be called 
	by the signal<ul>
		<li>0: no driver function is being called</li>
		<li>default: A driver stub is generated, which calls the MCAL driver - 
		typically this option will be used, as the API of driver functions often 
		do not comply with the RTE conventions</li>
		<li>specific function name: In case an existing function shall be 
		called.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The signal pool: Here, the memory region in which the signal will be 
	linked, is selected</li>
	<li>The ressource field allows the definition of a ressource, which will 
	protect the set and get methods in case the signal is used in more than one 
	task context. Use the button "New ressource" in case you want to add a new 
	ressource to the system.</li>
	<li>The onDataUpdate and onDataError events are fired to the receiver 
	runnables in case the data is changed or in case the signal is set invalid 
	(either from the user or by a driver call). Use the button "New event" in 
	case you want to add a new event to the system.</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Signal Objects" height="1071" src="gui_07.PNG" width="897">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the tab SWC's, we define the static structure of the system.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For every software component, a .c and .h file is created, containing 
	the component's runnables as functions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Software Components" height="1071" src="gui_08.PNG" width="897">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The static structure then is refined on the Runnable level.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The shortname, name and description follow the same convention as in the 
	other tabs.</li>
	<li>Every runnable belongs to a software component.</li>
	<li>And is executed in the context of a task.</li>
	<li>For cyclic runnables, a cycle time must be set, which must be a multiple 
	of the task tick time (set in the task tab)</li>
	<li>The signalIN and signalOut lists contain the signals which are being 
	used (either as input and/or output by the runnable.</li>
	<li>The events contain the events which activate the runnable (in addition 
	to the cycletime, if set)</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Runnable Tab" height="1071" src="gui_09.PNG" width="897"></p>
<p>The event tab contains the list of events.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Most events have been created by pressing the "New Event" button in the 
	signal object tab</li>
	<li>Additional application events may be created here, in case they are 
	needed, e.g. ev_isr_protocolBufferComplete, which is fired by a SetEvent 
	call in the UART isr.</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Event tab" height="1071" src="gui_10.PNG" width="897"></p>
<p>Like the events, the ressources typically are created by pressing the button 
"New Ressource" in the signal object tab.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Please note: For the ressources, we have to add a stub in 
the file rte_types.h.</p>
<p>If ressources are required:</p>
<pre>/**
* In case no ressources are required in the OS, the Resource Type Definition is missing.
* So we create a stub here. Must be commented out if we have real resources.
**/

// typedef uint32_t ResourceType;</pre>
<p>If no ressources are required, we have to uncomment the type definition:</p>
<pre>/**
* In case no ressources are required in the OS, the Resource Type Definition is missing.
* So we create a stub here. Must be commented out if we have real resources.
**/

   typedef uint32_t ResourceType;</pre>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Ressource tab" height="1071" src="gui_11.PNG" width="897"></p>
<h2><a name="Code_Generator">Code Generator</a></h2>
<p>The generator is an own tool, which can be invoked via the file menu of the 
GUI.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Select save and generate</li>
	<li>Upon calling the generator the first time, you will have to navigate to 
	the folder containing the generator ..\gen_jinja2\RteGen\__init__.py</li>
</ul>
<p>After running the generator, a command window should show up.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<img alt="Generator Window" height="433" src="Generator_01.PNG" width="764">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Generated output</h3>
<p>The output location has been set in the configuration tab of the GUI. The recommended structure inside a code workspace 
looks as follows:</p>
<pre>source\
source\asw      (application software modules, tasks, SWC's)
source\bsw      (application software basic driver modules)
source\rte      (source code for the runtime environment, signals)</pre>
<p>Especially if you use the generator for the first time, you might want to 
generate the code not directly into the code workspace, but into another 
location (in the example below the folder model) to avoid uncontrolled 
overwriting of your code</p>
<pre>model\          (location of the generator XML file)
model\out       (location for the generated code, rte.h, rte.c, rte_types.h)
model\out\asw   (generated software components and tasks)
model\out\rte   (generated signals)</pre>
<p>The subfolder names (asw, rte,..) are defined in the code generation 
templates. Use a tool like BeyondCompare to merge the generated code with your own code. 
Alternatively you may of course generate the code directly into you real code 
folder.</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Every generated source file contains User Code Sections. Code written in 
	these sections will not be overwritten. In other words - do not add any code 
	outside of these sections.</li>
	<li>The file rte.h, rte.c and rte_types.h need to be copied manually into 
	your source rte folder (only once)</li>
	<li>When using OSEK resources, the file rte_types.h needs to be modified. 
	Please check the comments inside.</li>
</ul>
<p>User Code sections look like this:</p>
<pre>/* USER CODE START TASK_TFT_USERDEFINITIONS */

/* USER CODE END TASK_TFT_USERDEFINITIONS */</pre>
<h3>Preparation of the generated code</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Copy the generated code into your code workspace.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>On the top level folder, you will find the following files, which should 
	be moved into the rte subfolder manually.<ul>
		<li>info.txt</li>
		<li>rte.c</li>
		<li>rte.h</li>
		<li>rte_types.h</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Make sure to add the folders to your make environment</li>
	<li>Compile the project</li>
</ol>
<p>The first compilation will create lot's of compiler errors. The reason is, 
that the internal structure&nbsp;of the signals as well as driver calls have to be 
added to your code. This needs to be done in the _type.x|.h files.</p>
<p>The _type.h files contain the definition of your class data type. The most 
relevant part is the following section:</p>
<pre>typedef 
/* USER CODE START SC_BUTTON_SIGNALDATADEFINITION */
struct
{
#error "Provide your data structure"
} 
/* USER CODE END SC_BUTTON_SIGNALDATADEFINITION */
SC_BUTTON_data_t;

/* USER CODE START InitSC_BUTTON */
#error "Provide a sensible init value"
#define SC_BUTTON_INIT_DATA ((SC_BUTTON_data_t){})
/* USER CODE END InitSC_BUTTON */</pre>
<p>Check the section containing #error directives. Here, you must add yopur 
code. You may use structs, enums or simple typedefs to in-built types to define 
the signal structure.</p>
<p>In case a in- or outdriver is defined, an additional _type.c file is created. 
In this function, you will call the peripheral driver and check for a valid 
value. </p>
<pre>/**
* Default IN driver API
*/
inline RC_t SC_BUTTON_driverIn(SC_BUTTON_data_t *const data)
{
/* USER CODE START driverInSC_BUTTON */
#error "Add your code here"

//Read data from the MCAL driver

//Scale it to the application type

return RC_SUCCESS;
/* USER CODE END driverInSC_BUTTON */
}</pre>
<p>Especially the scaler section provides lot's of flexibility and it is up to 
you to decide, if you want to place application code in this section or inside 
the runnable itself. As a rule of thumb, any application code related to the 
validity of the signal should be placed here, wereas "logical" code working with 
the signal belongs in the runnable.</p>
<p>Inside the runnables, use the provided API's of the signals to access the 
data. Typically you will use </p>
<ul>
	<li>getters and pullport at the beginning of your runnable </li>
	<li>and setters and pushport at the end. </li>
</ul>
<p>Check the file &nbsp;sp_&lt;your signalpool&gt; for declarations of the signals objects. 
All API's follow an object oriented approach, i.e. the signal object is passed 
as a first parameter.</p>
<pre>/*
* component: swc_Remote
* cycletime: 100
* description: Send protocol trhough XBEE
* events: ev_event_tx_onData
* name: REMOTE_sendProtocol_run
* shortname: sendProtocol

*/
void REMOTE_sendProtocol_run(RTE_event ev){

/* USER CODE START REMOTE_sendProtocol_run */

//Read in internal message
SC_EVENT_data_t event = SC_EVENT_INIT_DATA;
event = RTE_SC_EVENT_get(&amp;SO_EVENT_TX_signal);

//We need the state for special receiver id treatment in case of present protocol
SC_CONNECTIONSTATE_data_t state = SC_CONNECTIONSTATE_INIT_DATA;
state = RTE_SC_CONNECTIONSTATE_get(&amp;SO_CONNECTIONSTATE_signal);

//Do something with the data

RTE_SC_PROTOCOL_set(&amp;SO_PROTOCOLTX_signal, prot);
RTE_SC_PROTOCOL_pushPort(&amp;SO_PROTOCOLTX_signal);

/* USER CODE END REMOTE_sendProtocol_run */
}</pre>
<h3>Configuration of the OS</h3>
<p>Last but not least you will have to configure your RTOS by declaring all 
required tasks, alarms, events and ressources. It is recommended to copy and 
paste the names from the GUI into the RTOS configuration.</p>
<h2><a name="System_Maintenance">System Maintenance</a></h2>
<h3>Template Technology</h3>
<p>The template generator is based on the Jinja2 generator framework and&nbsp; 
beautifulsoup4. Check the following links for additional information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#">
	https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#</a> </li>
	<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">
	https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/</a> </li>
	<li><a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">
	https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Typically you only need to modify files stored in the template folder. The 
name of the file represents the artifact it is generating. cbase.c and h_base.h 
contain some common generator patterns.</p>
<p>In the file RTEgen.py, you will find a couple of preprocess functions, which 
are performing operations on the stored XML data, e.g. filtering the data and 
similar.</p>
<h3>Extension of the GUI</h3>
<p>The folder \gui\sources\uifiles\ contains XML files, which can be edited with 
the Python QT Designer (Python\Lib\site-packages\PySide2\designer.exe). Use 
gui\makeUI.py to create the python GUI framework.</p>
